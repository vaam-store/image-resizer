# --- Storage Configuration ---
# Choose storage type: "MINIO" or "LOCAL_FS"
# This variable dictates which storage backend is initialized.
STORAGE_TYPE="LOCAL_FS" # Or "S3"

# --- MinIO Configuration (REQUIRED if STORAGE_TYPE="MINIO") ---
MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:9000"
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID="minioadmin"
MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin"
MINIO_BUCKET="image-cache" # Ensure this bucket exists in MinIO and is publicly readable
MINIO_REGION="us-east-1" # Or your MinIO region if configured differently

# --- Local File System Configuration (REQUIRED if STORAGE_TYPE="LOCAL_FS") ---
# Local path where images will be stored within the container/host.
# For Docker, this path is inside the container. You'd typically use a volume mount.
LOCAL_FS_STORAGE_PATH="./data/images" # Example: relative to the executable

# --- General Configuration ---
# This is the base URL for the final redirect to the image.
# It should point to your CDN or the public endpoint of your chosen storage.
# If STORAGE_TYPE="MINIO", this is usually "http://<minio_host>:<port>/<minio_bucket>".
# If STORAGE_TYPE="LOCAL_FS" and Axum serves static files, this is "http://<server_host>:<port>/static".
CDN_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/images/files" # Default for MinIO setup
# If using LocalFS with Axum serving static files locally:
# CDN_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/static"
